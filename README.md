the point of design is information passing
this palette will try to pass information very clearly and easily to the user. that is the fundemental principle. it should be eazy to differentiate between different parts and eazy to read. it also should not be ugly. because ugly itself is an attention grabber that affects information retrieval.
this palette is a combination of two themes. one is the techno terminal techy theme. black, neon green, white, gray scale, etc. the second is utopia culture coded paradisal themed, softer pink, purple, blue etc. just to symbolize what we are aiming for.
this theme should be used in all my projects. from neovim text coloring to web pages. 
the background is pure black. because well the background has NO information.
the text is pure white. because pure white is a contrast to the background.
